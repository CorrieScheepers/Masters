# Storyline

## What is the purpose of your study?

- This study aims to develop a logging methodology to track user-based activities and perform analysis of the obtained logs to improve system maintenance in a software environment.
- First part of the study is to create and implement a logging methodology to capture user activities.
- The second part is the system utilisation analysis to improve software maintenance

## Why is the work important?

- Maintenance is essential for the total life cycle of a software system.
- 60%-80% of the total resources spent on maintenance.
- Maintenance will either be neglected or be prioritise for certain software systems.
- Identifying these systems and ranking the maintenance priority makes it easier to deliver the best software systems for most users.

## How did you do the work?

- Identified key logging points
- Created a logging mechanism to capture the logging points
- Analysed the logs for user behavioural patterns
- Rank software systems against each other
- Prioritise maintenance based on user's activities

## Most important results?

- Logging points identification
- User activities per software system
- Resource allocation to improve maintenance (focus on most used systems)
- Maintenance effort improvements

## Conclusions?

- Prioritising maintenance of software systems based on a utilisation analysis can improve the maintenance efforts of developers.
- Unused systems that are identified can be identified and removed.
- The most used systems will receive the highest maintenance priority.
