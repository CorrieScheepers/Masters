1. What is the purpose of your study?
This study aims to develop a logging mechanism to track user-based activities to perform analysis of these logs to improve system maintenance in a software environment. The study is divided into two components to achieve the primary goal, which is the design and implementation of the logging mechanism and the analysis of the system utilisation to finally improve system maintenance.

2. Why is the work important?
 Maintenande is essential for the total life cycle of a software system. With as much as 60%-80% of the total resources spent on maintenance for the software systems life cycle it can become costly and inefficient implementing maintenance. Maintenance will either be negledted or be priortise for ceratin software systems or parts of it. Identifying these systems and ranking the maintenance priority makes it easier to deliver the best software for the largets group of users.

3. How did you do the work?
  - Identified key logging points
  - Created a logging mechanism to capture the logging points
  - Analysed the logs for user behavioural patterns
  - Rank software systems against each other
  - Priortise maintenance based on user's activities

4. Most important results?
  - Logging points identification
  - User activities per software system
  - Resource allocation to improve maintenance

5. Conclusions?
 - Res
