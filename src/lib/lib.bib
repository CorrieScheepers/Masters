abstract = {Maintenance, traditionally the last phase of the Software Life Cycle, is usually overlooked, under documented, and never appreciated. Maintenance is usually thought of as "something that's done after the work is done" and is usually delegated to junior programmers. As a result the modified system can many times contain more defects that the original system.This article will describe the Software Maintenance Standard and how it can provide the foundation for better control of Maintenance.},
