\section{Preamble}
%TODO More Information in this section. Introduce the rest of the chapter
%TODO Too Specific 
In this chapter, the methodology to create and implement a logging mechanism to do system utilisation analysis on software system will be discussed. \Cref{sec:ch1_eventLogging} provided the necessary literature to create a logging mechanism in \Cref{sec:Ch3_LoggingMechanism} for two software systems.

\section{Logging mechanism}\label{sec:Ch3_LoggingMechanism}
For this study two software systems are used to implement two different logging mechanisms. The first software system which will be called System A, is an energy management system that uses \emph{PHP}. System B is a \emph{.NET Framework}\footnote{\label{ftn:NetFramework}\textbf{.NET Framework} is a run-time execution environment that consists of common language run-time (\emph{CLR}) and a \texttt{.NET Framework Class Library} \cite{Harkness2007}.} system with a \emph{MVC} architecture as in \Cref{fig:ch2_Flow_MVC_Architecture} and is the administrative software system to configure System A.

\subsection{System A}
Logging point is essential data that describes the event's key features when creating a log as discussed in \Cref{sec:ch1_loggignPoints}. Both System A and B have certain key logging points that need to be obtained from the user-generated event.

\subsubsection{System A's logging points}\label{sec:SystemA_LoggingPoints}
In \Cref{fig:ch2_SystemA_Dashboard} each mine group have multiple toolboxes linked to them. They can be the same toolbox linked to both mine groups such as \emph{T1} and \emph{T3}. These toolboxes represent a group of dashboards related to the aspects of energy management of mines.\par Each of these toolboxes have a dashboards linked to them and each mine group can have different dashboards linked to the to the same toolbox. Each one of these mine groups, toolboxes and dashboards forms part of System A's web pages which the user can access where event logs are generated.

\end{figure}

\clearpage

Each dashboard in \Cref{fig:ch2_SystemA_Dashboard} can use the same files to create a dashboard by only configuring the content of the dashboard based on the request parameters that is sent when the user navigates to a new dashboard. Capturing the user-generated events with a logging mechanism can be done in these shared files instead of the entire software components of System A.\par The user session helps to keep to track of any information needed for these pages to be fully functional like the user's identity and dashboard related data. This information can be used to give insight on which page the user is currently active on. In this case for System A the important user-session information is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User's identity:} The session contains the user's name and identity number which is the unique primary key for the user. This session information will always be available if the user is active on the software system from the instance they are logged in and verified until the user logs out and close their browser.
	\item \textbf{Group identity:} System A is used for multiple mine companies, each of the mining companies have a unique identity number. Each group have multiple toolboxes linked to them for energy management.
	\item \textbf{Dashboard identity:} Each dashboard uses certain files to construct a web page the user can view. To correctly navigate and get the correct page when the user request it, a unique identity number is used. In some cases for this system the same file can be used for multiple dashboards as extra configuration data is obtained from the database for that specific dashboard identity number.
	\item \textbf{Configuration meta data identity:} In \Cref{fig:ch2_SystemA_Dashboard} the same dashboard can be linked to different mine groups or toolboxes. The user session contains any other identification parameters of which meta data should be loaded to configure the dashboard for the correct mine group and toolbox.
\end{itemize}

		\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Obtaining the key information of the user generated event is essential to define which key logging points the logging mechanism needs to get from the user's session. In \Cref{tbl:Ch2_System_A_Logging_Points} System A's key logging points which are saved in a SQL database. Each logging point can be accessed either by the user session or other run-time data present when the event took place such as any meta data that as send back the server as request parameters.

The user activity types in \Cref{tbl:Ch2_SystemA_EventTypes} is all of the possible activities the user can generate in System A. The DetailView activities is expected to the largest portion of events that will be tracked as users will generally try to use multiple input elements on the dashboard or toolbox. \par The Dash event type is only useful to track which dashboards and toolboxes the user navigates to and it will not be an accurate indicator of how much a dashboard or toolbox is used. The DetailView and Report user activity types is better representation of the utilisation of these software components as these events are the user's objectives using the software systems and not trying to access the software systems.  

\begin{table}[!htb]

		\hline \textbf{Activity Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
		\hline \textbf{Dash} & Any activity that the user attempts to access a toolbox or dashboard on System A is Dash event type. \\
		\hline \textbf{DetailView} & Any other activities such as viewing certain date's data or editing and saving activities on System A is DetailView events and have other meta data which is the request parameters send back to server. These events exclude Report events. \\
		\hline \textbf{Report} & There are multiple detailed reports generated on these dashboards which are classified as Report events. \\
		\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Using the key logging points of \Cref{tbl:Ch2_System_A_Logging_Points} the \emph{ERD} for all the tables used for System A user activity logging data is created in \Cref{fig:Ch2_SystemA_Basic_ERD}. Table SystemA\_UserActvities is where all the user activity tracking data is stored in a SQL database with foreign key references to the Dashboards, Users and Groups tables.

In \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemBMetaData} is the metadata JSON for the RequestParameters column in \Cref{tbl:Ch2_System_A_Logging_Points}. This JSON contains certain data parameters important to the event that the user has initiated. This request parameters will need to be specified for each toolbox and dashboard the user events are logged off for System A.

\subsubsection{System A logging mechanism design}
\Cref{sec:SystemA_LoggingPoints} the logging points System A's key logging points need to be captured by a logging mechanism. In \Cref{fig:ch2_systemDesign2} is the design for the System A's logging mechanism to effectively log the user generated event from the PHP software components. The logging mechanism consist of two main functional requirements (\textbf{F/R}) which is the client and server functional requirements.

\begin{figure}[!htb] % An h :here, t: top, b: bottom.
	\centering % cent the figure
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Chapter2/SystemA_Architecture_Diagram/SystemA_Architecture_Diagram.pdf}
	\caption[System A logging mechanism architecture design]
	{\textit{System A logging mechanism architecture design}}\label{fig:ch2_systemDesign2}
\end{figure}

In the client's functional requirements (F/R 1) the user is the main focus and is the initiator of user activity event logs that take place in System A. The user has a direct interface (I/F 1.1) to the device (F/R 1.2) that is currently browsing System A's websites for specific tasks.\par If the user initiates an activity the request will in most cases either be handled in the dashboard manager of System A or on a defined file where the dashboards software components are. These activities are either captured by the logging mechanisms of \Cref{fig:ch2_Dash_PHP_Flow} or \Cref{fig:ch2_DetailView_Flow} that gets the necessary parameters and defines the type of the user generated event of \Cref{tbl:Ch2_SystemA_EventTypes}. \par The user-generated event (F/R 1.3) is sent to the user activity tracker logger (F/R 2.1) which is the database interaction of the logging mechanism as in \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemA_DB_Interaction_FlowDiagram} to create a log entry in the SQL database of (F/R 2.2).

\subsubsection{Dash user activty type classification}

In \Cref{fig:ch2_Dash_PHP_Flow} is the process of getting the Dash and Report user activity event type for System A. In System A there are certain software components in a dashboard manager file that manages the dashboards according to which the user has selected to view. This dashboard manager file will always execute the needed processes to manage the dashboard upon is the start-up phase.\par When the user sends a request to view a dashboard the requested dashboard's ID send to the dashboard manager. The dashboard manager will attempt to get the dashboard based on the provided dashboard ID. If the request doesn't contain a dashboard ID parameter, any attempt to log the activity will be ended and will be handled with the logging process described in \Cref{fig:ch2_DetailView_Flow}. \par If the dashboard ID parameter does exist and is not an empty or null value it will be added to the activity parameters. The activity parameters consist of some of the parameters needed for \Cref{tbl:Ch2_System_A_Logging_Points} when the event log is eventually saved in the database. \par In System A there are reports generated and some of the events of the report generation will use the dashboard manager's file. These user-generated events can only be traced there and will send an action parameter that is use to initiate the report generation process.\par The action parameters in System A is parameters set in the Post and Get methods. If the action parameter contains report generation value the activity type needs to be set to the Report user activity type otherwise it is set the Dash user activity type. After the additional parameters and activity type parameters are set the ActivityTracker function is called to complete the log and save it in the SQL database as in \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemA_DB_Interaction_FlowDiagram}.

\end{figure}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{User activity logging process of DetailView and Report event types}

In \Cref{fig:ch2_DetailView_Flow} is the process of getting the DetailView and Report user activity event type for System A. This logging process is used in each file that dashboards are created from. In \Cref{fig:ch2_SystemA_Dashboard} multiple dashboards can use the same files with different configuration parameters send with the request, therefore this significantly reduces the needed development to enable the user activity tracking for the dashboards.\par After the user has navigated to their selected dashboard, any user generated request is logged as user activities in System A. These events can be divided into the DetailView and Report event types based on their action parameters that is sent with the request. If the event doesn't have any action parameters, the logging process terminates as this event doesn't count as a valid user activity event.\par If the event does have any action parameters it is checked whether the parameters have report generation value or not. If the event have report action values then the user activity type is set to the Report event type otherwise it is set to DetailView event type.\par There may exist any additional parameters that is send with the request that can be logged. These parameters will vary more than the additional parameters of the Dash events as the Dash events parameters is used to configure the dashboard and not get certain variations activities the user performs on the dashboard.\par If the additional parameters are not null or empty values they are added to the ActivityParameters. With the set ActivityParameters and the defined user activity type the ActivityTracker process of \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemA_DB_Interaction_FlowDiagram} to create a log entry that is saved in the SQL database.

\subsubsection{Database interaction of the logging mechanism}\label{sec:CH2_SystemA_DB_Interaction_FlowDiagram}

In \Cref{fig:ch2_Dash_PHP_Flow,fig:ch2_DetailView_Flow} the user-generated event is captured with additional parameters that may exist with the captured event. The next process in \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemA_DB_Interaction_FlowDiagram} is save the generated user activity log in a database.\par \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemA_DB_Interaction_FlowDiagram} is the process which the logging mechanism will create a log entry by first initialising the SQL database connection. The last parameter needed to complete the requirements of the logging points in \Cref{tbl:Ch2_System_A_Logging_Points} is the user's identification. This is obtained from the user's session that contains the user's ID number that is assigned in the Users table.\par The ActivityParameters from  \Cref{fig:ch2_Dash_PHP_Flow,fig:ch2_DetailView_Flow} are encoded as a JSON string to be saved in the RequestParameters column. After all the parameters are converted to correct format the SQL query created and executed to save the log entry in the SystemA\_UserActivities table of \Cref{fig:Ch2_SystemA_Basic_ERD}.

\subsection{System B}

\subsubsection{System B's logging points}

In \Cref{fig:ch2_Flow_MVC_Architecture} is a diagram of the request flow of a MVC architecture that shows how the user interacts with it. The user will send multiple requests from their own device (client device) via an Internet connection to the server that processes the request. The software system will read and write data from the database source to create a result that send back to the client device for the user. System B is based on this type of architecture to display multiple menus to the user. 

\begin{figure}[!htb] % An h :here, t: top, b: bottom.
	\centering % cent the figure
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Chapter2/Flow_MVC_Architecture/Flow_MVC_Architecture.pdf}
	\caption[Request flow in MVC architecture]
	{\textit{Request flow in MVC architecture \cite{Gu2010}}}\label{fig:ch2_Flow_MVC_Architecture}
\end{figure}

In \Cref{sec:SystemA_LoggingPoints} System A mostly relies on the user sessions data to obtain the user-generated event's data, for System B this data can be obtained by the FilterContext class in ASP.NET MVC. The FilterContext provides contains the following information about the request:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Absolute URI path:} The string containing the absolute URI path the current controller that is active is part of the FilterContext. This does not reference the controller that handles the request but the controller that user is active on before initiating the request. 
	\item \textbf{Absolute request URL:} The requested URL contains the controller's name and function that process requests. This reference the controller that handles the request but the controller that user is active on before initiating the request. Most of System B's menus are partitioned in separate units which is called Areas in the ASP.NET MVC projects. The area from which the controller is is also part the of this path.
	\item \textbf{Action parameters:} The FilterContext contains action parameters which are the request parameters send with the AJAX request from the client device. These parameters are used in the function that is being called to do certain task within the controller.
\end{itemize}

In System B's session information the user's identification credentials are stored and is used to identify which user initiated the event that is processed.

\clearpage

Using the information from the FilterContext and session of System B the key logging points can be obtained to create \Cref{tbl:CH2_SystemB_LoggingTable} that is saved in SQL database. Each of this logging points can be accessed through a filter action to capture run-time data such as the action parameters that are part of the metadata.

\begin{table}[!htb]
	\centering
	\small
	\caption[System B user activities table]
	{\textit{System B user activities table}}

		\hline \textbf{ActivityID} & INT(11) & The activity identification is an incremental number of the event that is logged.\\
		\hline \textbf{Timestamp} & DATETIME & This is the time which the event took place.\\
		\hline \textbf{ActivityType} & ENUM & Each event that the user initiate has an activity type as in \Cref{tbl:Ch2_SystemB_ActivityTypes}. This activity type is dependent if the controller's called method is the index action or based on the HTML element that is part of the meta data. \\
		\hline \textbf{UserID} & INT(4) & Each user has a unique identifier which is a numerical identification number that is foreign key reference to the User table. \\
		\hline \textbf{Area} & VARCHAR(45) & This information is logged to track user activities per Area that represents different software systems that the user can use. \\
		\hline \textbf{Controller} & TEXT & Each event will point back to an controller that process the request. \\
		\hline \textbf{GroupID} & INT(4) & This foreign key reference to the Group table is contract groups identification number. \\
		\hline \textbf{MetaData} & JSON & The meta data of the event contains request parameters, the HTML element from which the request is initiated and other relevant request data of the event. This can also be other meta data is important to get that adds more information about the user's activity using certain controls on System B as in \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemBMetaData}. \\
		\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

In \Cref{fig:CH2_SystemBMetaData} the metadata JSON for the user activity log obtained. This JSON contains the request origin of the event from the absolute URI path, HTML element that user used to initiate the event and the request parameters sent with the AJAX request. Some of these JSON parameters can be empty depending on the type of activity.

The user activity types in \Cref{tbl:Ch2_SystemB_ActivityTypes} is all of the possible activities the user can generate in System B. The MenuAccessed activity type can be used to track how the user is navigating through the System B just like System A's Dash user activity type. The CustomControls and ElementClickEvents user activity types is the best representation of the system utilisation of System B by the users.

		\hline \textbf{Activity Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
		\hline \textbf{MenuAccessed} & These events are any user activities where the user attempts to access a menu on System B which calls the index method of the menu's controller. In most cases the event request from the client side will be handled by the controller's index function to send back a response of the initial accessing of a specific menu. \\
		\hline \textbf{LogoutAttempt} & Any logout attempt from the user except closing the browser tab or browser. Closing the browser or tab doesn't send any request from the client device back to the server to log that user ended their session. \\
		\hline \textbf{LoginAttempt} & Any user activities on the login page of System B where the user will try enter their credentials to gain access to their user accounts on System B.\\
		\hline \textbf{SessionTracking} & This is any user activities that directly involves extension session due that System B will attempt to logout the user after a hour of inactivity prompting the user to extend their own session.\\
		\hline \textbf{ResetPassword} & Any user activities when the user attempts to reset their password. \\

\section{System utilisation analysis}

\section{Integration}
In this section, the integration of the utilisation analysis and logging mechanism will be discussed.

\section{Conclusion}
Conclude the chapter about the development of the logging mechanism and utilisation analysis.

Most Web applications will make of use JavaScript to control the content of the page that is being displayed to the user. The primary method would be making use of an \textit{AJAX request} to communicate with the server to fulfil the user's action.\par The \textit{AJAX request} has some key features that will enable the logging points discussed in \Cref{sec:ch2_loggingPoints} to capture some logging attributes and classify the event as a user-based activity. \par The \texttt{beforeSend} setting of the \textit{AJAX request} enables tracking in real-time for the HTML element id and its HTML tag or other possible log attributes that need to be added to the request for the log point to capture it. The captured HTML element id, HTML tag and some other parameters can be added as a custom request header that will be sent to the server.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\Roman*.}]
	\item \textbf{Methodology:} In \Cref{chap:2} development of solution functional requirements is made in \Cref{sec:ch2_developementOfSolution}. This provides a generic method to create a logging mechanism and analyse the obtained user-based logs. A test logging mechanism is designed with a log analysis of usage to validate the development of solution functional requirements of \Cref{tbl:ch2_developmenetRequirements}.\par This logging mechanism aims to implement each subfunctional requirement on a test system by testing certain inputs to verify expected outputs. The following validation method was used for this test implementation in \Cref{sec:ch3_implementation}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Identifying and creating the log attributes needed for the log analysis (\ref{fr:logAttributes}). The software system's key log attributes are precisely defined for maintenance prioritisation. The user-activity type forms the base requirement for a user-based log.
			
			\item Logging points are made to capture these logging attributes at specific locations in the software system (\ref{fr:loggingPoints}). The placement of the logging points to capture user-based logs is verified if it can be done consistently, accurately and discretely without impacting the software system's performance. 
			
			\item The log analysis is verified using a third-party log analysis tool or implementation of a log analysis (\ref{fr:logAnalysis}). For the log analysis to succeed, the quality must be acceptable. This is verified by the logging points' performance and the usability of the logs without too many post-logging corrections made.
			
			\item Creating software maintenance prioritising (\ref{fr:maintenancePrioritising}) from the results of the log analysis. In the log analysis, the different subsystems' maintenance priority ($M_{PF}$) are calculated from the normalised total active users ($P_N$) multiplied by the normalised total user activity ($A_N$) for a specified subsystem in \Cref{eq:ch2_priorityNormalised,eq:ch2_maintenanceFactorSimplified,eq:ch2_eventNormalised}.\par These results are verified with the test case study and Case Studies A, B and C in \Cref{sec:ch3_caseStudies} on different software systems with different operational use cases. The results obtained for the maintenance priority validate the implementation of the previous above using the defined user-based logs to do the log analysis for maintenance priority. 
		\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Study objectives:} The study objectives in \Cref{sec:ch1_objectives} is validated through the method used in \Cref{chap:2} by:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Logging mechanism:}
			  \begin{enumerate}
				\item The log attributes need to be defined for the log analysis. In this study, the log analysis is for maintenance prioritisation. The method created demonstrates the functional requirements to develop the required criteria for which events in the software system are user-based events.
				\item the defined functional requirements for a user-based event log validate item User-based events classification objective. The method to only use the needed log attributes and user activity types describes what events are potentially user-based.
				\item Logging points are the main structure of the logging mechanism. A guideline on strategically placing logging points in a software system is provided in \Cref{sec:ch2_loggingPoints}. This section focuses on how to log in to both client and server side to get all the needed log attributes.

			\item \textbf{Log analysis:}
			 \begin{enumerate}
				\item The log analysis evaluates the obtained logs for user-based utilisation results. The evaluation is proven by using third-party or custom-made software to do a comprehensive log analysis to validate if this objective has been met.
				\item The user-based utilisation log analysis implementation needs to create a software maintenance prioritisation. The proposed method to create a consistent measurement to rank software systems based on the needed maintenance validates this objective in the method.
			 \end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Need of the study:} There is a need to create a logging mechanism for a log analysis for software maintenance prioritisation. Fulfilling this need can be a valuable method for industry developers to improve the resources used to implement software maintenance more efficiently. The study objectives broke down the needed objectives for this need to be satisfied by splitting it into two parts: logging mechanism and log analysis. 
	\item \textbf{Problem statement:} Software maintenance is a problem in the industry due to how inefficiently developers prioritise maintenance activities. A proven method to monitor software behaviours is logging. The need for study emphasised that the logging mechanism and log analysis to improve software maintenance needs to be explicitly designed for user-based events.
	\item \textbf{Gap identification:} Software maintenance is an important stage in most software development. Implementing it efficiently with the available resources that organisations or individuals have is beneficial. Assisting developers to make better-informed decisions on which systems to prioritise maintenance is a validated gap by identifying the problems that need to be resolved.

In \Cref{fig:ch2_systemDesign} is the basic system design of the logging mechanism. This design provides a high-level overview of the interaction the user has with the software system to create a user-based event log. The two sides of the design in \Cref{fig:ch2_systemDesign}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Client} side which involves the user, the device the user uses to access the website and the user-generated event. The user interacts with the website, this creates a user event that can be captured. 
	\item \textbf{Server} side which has the rest of user activity logging software that consists of multiple or a single logging point. The user activity logger interacts with a structured database to store the captured log created from all the captured log attributes.
\end{itemize}
