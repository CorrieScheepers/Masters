Software maintenance is continuous and a form of software development process. Research suggests that $15\%$ of the total development cost should be allocated to implement a maintenance model for a software system. Unused components or non-compliant software will increase over the project's life cycle. The discontinuation of some systems may reduce the resources required to maintain the entire project or modify the software resources effectively to improve software maintenance efforts. Deciding how many resources to allocate for maintenance to each system can be challenging without a suitable method.\par Software logging is crucial to improve software maintenance via troubleshooting. In extensive software systems, logging enables the development team to monitor specific events. A suitable logging mechanism can identify the system usage for each software system. In web-based applications, user interactions with each software system determine usage. The interactions between the user and the software system can be logged.\par Analysing logs can be challenging if the logging mechanism does not track the desired user-based events. Developing a method to track these events for a specific purpose is more efficient. Relevant data produce effective analysis and enhance the optimisation of a model. Therefore, integrating the method to create a logging mechanism and analysing data improves software system maintenance\par This study developed a method to track user activities in a web-based application. The logging mechanism captures any user activity on the software systems with which they interact. HTTP requests have more significant and relevant data than tracking each user action of a specific event. Monitoring each HTTP request generated from the user's activities is the primary communication interface between the user's client device and the server that runs the software systems.\par Analysis of the logs obtained from the user activity logging mechanism compares the use of the software system and allocated maintenance resources. These comparisons enable us to make new decisions about software maintenance. This is part of data-driven decision-making with respect to the use of various software components.
