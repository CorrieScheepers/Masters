% TODO Edit Abstract

Maintenance of software is continuous and is a reduced form of software
development. Research suggests that $15\%$ of the total development cost is to
implement a maintenance model on a specific software system. Unused software
components or software not meeting the user's requirements will increase over
the life cycle of the project. Deprecating some of these systems may reduce the
number of resources needed to maintain the entire project. Deciding how much
resources for maintenance needs to allocated to each system can be difficult
without a suitable method.

Software logging is an essential mechanism to improve software maintenance in the
form of troubleshooting. In large software systems logging enables the
development team to monitor specific events. System utilisation of each software
system can be identified if a suitable logging mechanism is implemented. In
Web-based applications the utilisation of each software system is based on how
much the users will interact with it. The interactions between the user the
software system can be logged.

Analysing these logs can be difficult when the logging mechanism does not track
the desired user-based events. Developing a method to track these events for a
specific purpose is more efficient. Relevant data creates a more effective
analysis of a specific topic and increases the optimisation of a model. The need to
integrate the method used to create a logging mechanism and analysing the data
will improve the maintenance of software systems.

During this study, a method is developed for a Web-based application to track the
user's activities. The logging mechanism is designed to get any user activities
on any software systems they are interacting with. Ajax-requests contains
significant and relevant data than tracking all the actions of the user of a
specific event. Capturing each Ajax-requests generated from the user activities
is the main communication interface between the user's client device and the
server that runs the software systems.

The analysis is performed on the logs that were obtained from the user activity
logging mechanism. Software systems utilisation is compared to each other. The
resources allocated to maintain each software system is compared to each other.
Using the resource allocated and the system utilisation new decisions can be
made of the software maintenance. This formed part of the data-driven decision making
about the utilisation of the different software components.
