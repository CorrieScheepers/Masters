Maintenance of software is continuous and is a reduced form of software development. These systems are complex and may be inefficient as the need for new development increases. Utilisation of the software systems may become difficult to track as the development continues.

About $15\%$ of the total development costs is allocated to create a maintenance model for a specific software system. In some cases maintenance may be neglected due various reasons. Unused software components or software not meeting the user's requirements will increase over the life cycle of the project.

Tracking the users activities can be a solution of how the system is used to improve software maintenance. Currently logging is used to track any events that occurs any given software system. Analysing these logs provides the nesseacary data for developers of the software system. This mainly use for system troubleshooting. The need to create a suitable logging method for the purpose of analysing user activities will improve software maintenance.

During this study a method was developed for Web-based application to track the user's activities. The method is split-up into creating a suitable logging method to track the user's activities and analysis of the logs. The functionality of these methods address the need of the study to create complete integrated method. Each menu that the user access and does various activities on is tracked by the logging mechanism.

Analysis was performed on the logs that was obtained from the user activity logging mechanism. A select few menu's are compared to each other based on log events. This quantifies the utilisation of each menu and is compared to the intended expectation of how much the menu should be utilised by the users. This is the resource allocated to the menu in the form of the total development that is spend on it. This form part the data-driven decision making about the utilisation of the different software components.
