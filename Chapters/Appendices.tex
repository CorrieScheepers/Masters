\chapter{Logging practice in software engineering}\label{apx:loggingPractice}
Providing a guide for software engineers and developers to implement a suitable logging mechanism in their software systems has proven to be a vital tool for both industrial use and academic progress \cite{Rong2018a}. Guoping Rong et al. conducted a study to review published papers on logging practices and improve the performance and efficiency of logging implementation. From their study, they established selection criteria for including (as in \Cref{tbl:CH1_RongIncSelectionCriteria}) and excluding (as in \Cref{tbl:CH1_RongExlSelectionCriteria}) academic papers about logging practices \cite{Rong2018a,Rong2018}.\par Rong's selection criteria yielded numerous research papers on logging practices applied in the industry, either through creating a new logging mechanism or optimizing existing logging mechanisms. By reviewing 41 identified papers, they found that many practitioners and researchers recognize the importance of logging practices in software engineering. However, there is a lack of guidance available to provide software engineers or developers with the necessary tools to create or improve efficient logging mechanisms \cite{Rong2018a,Zhu2015}.

\Cref{fig:PushblisedPapers} shows the distribution of the 41 published papers obtained for Rong's research on logging practices. Event logging has an increasingly important role in modern software systems; therefore, research on logging practices in software engineering has been on the rise between 1990 and 2017.
