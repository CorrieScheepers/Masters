\chapter{Logging practise in software engineering}\label{apx:loggingPractice}
Providing a guide for software engineers and developers to implement a suitable logging mechanism in their software systems has proven to be a vital tool for both industrial use and academic progress \cite{Rong2018a}. \cite{Rong2018a} conducted a study to review published articles on logging practises and improve the performance and efficiency of logging implementation. From their study, they established selection criteria to include (as in \Cref{tbl:CH1_RongIncSelectionCriteria}) and exclude (as in \Cref{tbl:CH1_RongExlSelectionCriteria}) academic papers on logging practises \cite{Rong2018a,Rong2018}.\par Rong's selection criteria yielded numerous research articles on logging practises applied in the industry, either through creating a new logging mechanism or optimising existing logging mechanisms. Reviewing 41 identified articles, they found that many practitioners and researchers recognise the importance of logging practises in software engineering. However, there is a lack of guidance available to provide software engineers or developers with the tools necessary to create or improve efficient logging mechanisms \cite{Rong2018a,Zhu2015}.

\Cref{fig:PushblisedPapers} shows the distribution of the 41 published papers obtained for \cite{Rong2018a} research on logging practises. Event logging plays an increasingly important role in modern software systems; therefore, research on logging practises in software engineering has been on the rise between 1990 and 2017.
